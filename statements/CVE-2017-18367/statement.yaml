vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-18367
notes:
- links: []
  text: libseccomp-golang 0.9.0 and earlier incorrectly generates BPFs that OR multiple
    arguments rather than ANDing them. A process running under a restrictive seccomp
    filter that specified multiple syscall arguments could bypass intended access
    restrictions by specifying a single matching argument.
