vulnerability_id: CVE-2013-1801
notes:
- links: []
  text: The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
    of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection
    attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
    consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion, a similar
    vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
