vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-16003
notes:
- links: []
  text: windows-build-tools is a module for installing C++ Build Tools for Windows
    using npm. windows-build-tools versions below 1.0.0 download resources over HTTP,
    which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote
    code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested resources with an attacker
    controlled copy if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the
    user and the remote server.
