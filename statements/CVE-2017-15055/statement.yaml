vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-15055

- links: []
  text: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control when
    requesting items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into
    a directory controlled by the attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory,
    delete an arbitrary item, delete the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy
    the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer, access the history
    of an arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory. To exploit
    the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with the requests sent
    directly, for example by changing the "item_id" parameter when invoking "copy_item"
    on items.queries.php.
