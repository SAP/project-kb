- links: []
  text: An issue was discovered in switchGroup() in agent/ExecHelper/ExecHelperMain.cpp
    in Phusion Passenger before 5.3.2. The set of groups (gidset) is not set correctly,
    leaving it up to randomness (i.e., uninitialized memory) which supplementary groups
    are actually being set while lowering privileges.
