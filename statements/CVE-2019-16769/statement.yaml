vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-16769
notes:
- links: []
  text: The serialize-javascript npm package before version 2.1.1 is vulnerable to
    Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters
    in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js
    environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes
    all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression
    objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this
    vulnerability.
