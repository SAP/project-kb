  text: '** DISPUTED ** TAXII libtaxii through 1.1.117, as used in EclecticIQ OpenTAXII through 0.2.0 and other products, allows SSRF via an initial http:// substring to the parse method, even when the no_network setting is used for the XML parser. NOTE: the vendor points out that the parse method "wraps the lxml library" and that this may be an issue to "raise ... to the lxml group."'
