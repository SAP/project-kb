vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-10248
notes:
- links: []
  text: Eclipse Vorto versions prior to 0.11 resolved Maven build artifacts for the
    Xtext project over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these dependent artifacts could
    have been maliciously compromised by a MITM attack. Hence produced build artifacts
    of Vorto might be infected.
