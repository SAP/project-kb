notes:
- text: In version from 3.0.0 to 3.5.3 of Eclipse Vert.x, the StaticHandler uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '\' (forward slashes) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory when running on Windows Operating Systems.
