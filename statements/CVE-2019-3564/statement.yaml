  text: Go Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with containers
    of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages
    which would take a long time for the server to parse, potentially leading to denial
    of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.03.04.00.
