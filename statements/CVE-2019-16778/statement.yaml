  text: In TensorFlow before 1.15, a heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum can
    be produced when the Index template argument is int32. In this case data_size
    and num_segments fields are truncated from int64 to int32 and can produce negative
    numbers, resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory. This is unlikely to
    be exploitable and was detected and fixed internally in TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0.
