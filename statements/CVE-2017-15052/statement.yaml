vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-15052
notes:
- links: []
  text: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control
    when requesting users.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to delete
    an arbitrary user (including admin), or modify attributes of any arbitrary user
    except administrator. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker
    must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests
    sent directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_user"
    on users.queries.php.
