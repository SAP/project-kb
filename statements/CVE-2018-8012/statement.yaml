vulnerability_id: CVE-2018-8012
notes:
- text: No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum in Apache ZooKeeper before 3.4.10, and 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.3-beta. As a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.
