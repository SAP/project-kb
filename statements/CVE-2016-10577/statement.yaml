vulnerability_id: CVE-2016-10577
notes:
- links: []
  text: ibm_db is an asynchronous/synchronous interface for node.js to IBM DB2 and
    IBM Informix. ibm_db before 1.0.2 downloads binary resources over HTTP, which
    leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code
    execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled
    binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and
    the remote server.
