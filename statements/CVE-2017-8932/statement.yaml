  text: A bug in the standard library ScalarMult implementation of curve P-256 for
    amd64 architectures in Go before 1.7.6 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2 causes incorrect
    results to be generated for specific input points. An adaptive attack can be mounted
    to progressively extract the scalar input to ScalarMult by submitting crafted
    points and observing failures to the derive correct output. This leads to a full
    key recovery attack against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.
