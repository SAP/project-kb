  text: sequelize is an Object-relational mapping, or a middleman to convert things
    from Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server into usable data
    for NodeJS. Before version 1.7.0-alpha3, sequelize defaulted SQLite to use MySQL
    backslash escaping, even though SQLite uses Postgres escaping.
