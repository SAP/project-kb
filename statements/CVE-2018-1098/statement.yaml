vulnerability_id: CVE-2018-1098
notes:
- links: []
  text: A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An
    attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server
    and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't
    PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an
    attacker can send.
