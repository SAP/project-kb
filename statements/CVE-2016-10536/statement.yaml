vulnerability_id: CVE-2016-10536
notes:
- links: []
  text: engine.io-client is the client for engine.io, the implementation of a transport-based
    cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. The
    vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized`
    setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification
    will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client 1.6.8 and earlier passes
    in an object for settings that includes the rejectUnauthorized property, whether
    it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will
    be passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.
