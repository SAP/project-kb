vulnerability_id: CVE-2014-7193
notes:
- links: []
  text: The Crumb plugin before 3.0.0 for Node.js does not properly restrict token
    access in situations where a hapi route handler has CORS enabled, which allows
    remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, and potentially obtain the ability
    to spoof requests to non-CORS routes, via a crafted web site that is visited by
    an application consumer.
