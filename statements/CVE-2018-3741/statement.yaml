vulnerability_id: CVE-2018-3741
notes:
- links: []
  text: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem versions
    below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present
    in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these
    attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target applications. This issue is similar
    to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users running an affected release should either
    upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
