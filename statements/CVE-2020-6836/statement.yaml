vulnerability_id: CVE-2020-6836
notes:
- links: []
  text: grammar-parser.jison in the hot-formula-parser package before 3.0.1 for Node.js
    is vulnerable to arbitrary code injection. The package fails to sanitize values
    passed to the parse function and concatenates them in an eval call. If a value
    of the formula is taken from user-controlled input, it may allow attackers to
    run arbitrary commands on the server.
