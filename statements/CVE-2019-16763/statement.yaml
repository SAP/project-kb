vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-16763
notes:
- links: []
  text: In Pannellum from 2.5.0 through 2.5.4 URLs were not sanitized for data URIs
    (or vbscript:), allowing for potential XSS attacks. Such an attack would require
    a user to click on a hot spot to execute and would require an attacker-provided
    configuration. The most plausible potential attack would be if pannellum.htm was
    hosted on a domain that shared cookies with the targeted site's user authentication;
    an &lt;iframe&gt; could then be embedded on the attacker's site using pannellum.htm
    from the targeted site, which would allow the attacker to potentially access information
    from the targeted site as the authenticated user (or worse if the targeted site
    did not have adequate CSRF protections) if the user clicked on a hot spot in the
    attacker's embedded panorama viewer. This was patched in version 2.5.5.
