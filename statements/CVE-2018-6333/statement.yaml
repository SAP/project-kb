vulnerability_id: CVE-2018-6333
notes:
- links: []
  text: The hhvm-attach deep link handler in Nuclide did not properly sanitize the
    provided hostname parameter when rendering. As a result, a malicious URL could
    be used to render HTML and other content inside of the editor's context, which
    could potentially be chained to lead to code execution. This issue affected Nuclide
    prior to v0.290.0.
