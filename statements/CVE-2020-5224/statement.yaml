vulnerability_id: CVE-2020-5224
notes:
- links: []
  text: In Django User Sessions (django-user-sessions) before 1.7.1, the views provided
    allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify
    sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem.
    However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted
    by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.
