- links: []
  text: Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass before
    2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
    HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2) user log history. To exploit the
    vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For
    the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field
    of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload
    within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From
    there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.
