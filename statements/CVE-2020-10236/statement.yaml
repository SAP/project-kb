vulnerability_id: CVE-2020-10236
notes:
- links: []
  text: An issue was discovered in Froxlor before 0.10.14. It created files with static
    names in /tmp during installation if the installation directory was not writable.
    This allowed local attackers to cause DoS or disclose information out of the config
    files, because of _createUserdataConf in install/lib/class.FroxlorInstall.php.
