vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-16779
notes:
- links: []
  text: In RubyGem excon before 0.71.0, there was a race condition around persistent
    connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would
    leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning
    content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short,
    and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.
