vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-16613
notes:
- links: []
  text: 'An issue was discovered in middleware.py in OpenStack Swauth through 1.2.0
    when used with OpenStack Swift through 2.15.1. The Swift object store and proxy
    server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication
    mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass
    authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request.
    NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by
    an official OpenStack project team.'
