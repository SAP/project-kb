notes:
- links: []
  text: It was found that Keycloak's Node.js adapter before version 4.8.3 did not
    properly verify the web token received from the server in its backchannel logout
    . An attacker with local access could use this to construct a malicious web token
    setting an NBF parameter that could prevent user access indefinitely.
