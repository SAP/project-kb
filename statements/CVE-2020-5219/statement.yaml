  text: Angular Expressions before version 1.0.1 has a remote code execution vulnerability
    if you call expressions.compile(userControlledInput) where userControlledInput
    is text that comes from user input. If running angular-expressions in the browser,
    an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
    If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript
    expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.
