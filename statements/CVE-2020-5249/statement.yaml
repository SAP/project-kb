  text: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma allows
    untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return
    character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers
    or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response
    Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several
    other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247,
    which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed
    in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.
