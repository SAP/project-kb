vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-15053
notes:
- links: []
  text: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control
    when requesting roles.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to modify
    any arbitrary roles within the application, or delete any arbitrary role. To exploit
    the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights on the
    application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing
    the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_role" on roles.queries.php.
