vulnerability_id: CVE-2013-1800
notes:
- links: []
  text: The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
    of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection
    attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
    consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or
    (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
