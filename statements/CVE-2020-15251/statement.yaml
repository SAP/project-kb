  text: In the Channelmgnt plug-in for Sopel (a Python IRC bot) before version 1.0.3, malicious users are able to op/voice and take over a channel. This is an ACL bypass vulnerability. This plugin is bundled with MirahezeBot-Plugins with versions from 9.0.0 and less than 9.0.2 affected. Version 9.0.2 includes 1.0.3 of channelmgnt, and thus is safe from this vulnerability.
