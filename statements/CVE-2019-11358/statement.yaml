vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-11358
notes:
- links: []
  text: jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products,
    mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution.
    If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it
    could extend the native Object.prototype.
