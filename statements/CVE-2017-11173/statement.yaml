vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-11173
notes:
- links: []
  text: Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors before 0.4.1 allows a malicious
    third-party site to perform CORS requests. If the configuration were intended
    to allow only the trusted example.com domain name and not the malicious example.net
    domain name, then example.com.example.net (as well as example.com-example.net)
    would be inadvertently allowed.
