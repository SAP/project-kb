Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded \"/\" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.",

Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.",

This means that SSL certificates of other hosts are blindly accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the Spring RabbitMQ Java Client and an RabbitMQ server it's connecting to. TLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client. Spring AMQP uses the RabbitMQ amqp-client java library for communication with RabbitMQ. It uses the RabbitConnectionFactoryBean to create/configure the connection factory.\\n Affected Versions: \\n - Spring-AMQP versions prior to 1.7.10 and 2.0.6 /n - RabbitMQ amqp-client versions prior to 4.8.0 and 5.4.0 .\\n Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: \\n - Upgrade to the 1.7.10.RELEASE or 2.0.6.RELEASE and set the enableHostnameValidation property to true. Override the transitive amqp-client version to at least 4.8.0 and 5.4.0, respectively. \\n - The upcoming 2.1.0.RELEASE will set the property to true by default.\\n - If you are using the amqp-client library directly to create a connection factory, refer to its javadocs for the enableHostnameValidation() method.",

        "descriptionAlt": "Apache CXF Fediz is vulnerable to DTD based XML attacks\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.4.\n\nDescription:\n\nApache CXF Fediz is a subproject of Apache CXF which implements the\nWS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile for SSO specification.\n\nIn 2015, a security advisory CVE-2015-5175 was issued for Apache CXF Fediz, \ntitled \"Apache CXF Fediz application plugins are vulnerable to Denial of\nService (DoS) attacks\". This was due to the fact that Document Type\nDeclarations (DTDs) were not disabled when parsing the response from the\nIdentity Provider (IdP).\n\nThe fix for advisory CVE-2015-5175 in Apache CXF Fediz 1.1.3 and 1.2.1 \nprevented DoS style attacks via DTDs. However, it did not fully disable DTDs,\nmeaning that the Fediz plugins could potentially be subject to a DTD-based\nXML attack.\n\nIn addition, the Apache CXF Fediz IdP is also potentially subject to DTD-based\nXML attacks for some of the WS-Federation request parameters.\n\nThis has been fixed in revision:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf-fediz/commit/b6ed9865d0614332fa419fe4b6d0fe81bc2e660d\n\nMigration:\n\nApache CXF Fediz users should upgrade to 1.4.4 as soon as possible.",

FreeIPA (ipa.local) and Active Directory (ad.local) users can be made available on the OS level by something like sssd. The trusted users will be of the form 'user@ad.local' while other users are will not contain the domain. Executing 'id -Gn user@ad.local' will successfully return the groups the user belongs to if configured correctly. However, it is assumed by Hadoop that users of the format with '@' cannot be correct. This code is in KerberosName.java and seems to be a validator if the 'auth_to_local' rules are applied correctly. In my opinion this should be removed or changed to a different kind of check or maybe logged as a warning while still proceeding, as the current behavior limits integration possibilities with other standard tools.

Such applications must also have a registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource.\n\nSpring Boot applications that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static resources out of the box and are therefore vulnerable.\n\nAffected Pivotal Products and Versions:\n- Spring Framework 5.1\n- Spring Framework 5.0.0 to 5.0.9\n- Spring Framework 4.3 to 4.3.19\n- Older unsupported versions going back to 4.2 are also affected\n\nMitigation:\nUsers of affected versions should apply the following mitigation.\n- 5.1 users should upgrade to 5.1.1\n- 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.10\n- 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.20\n- 4.2.x users should upgrade to a supported branch.\nNo further mitigation steps are necessary.\n\nNote the following when evaluating the impact:\nSupport for Range requests was introduced in version 4.2. Therefore versions prior to 4.2 are not affected by this issue.\nSupport for returning an org.springfamework.core.io.Resource from an annotated controller was introduced in 5.0. Therefore versions prior to 5.0 can only be impacted through a registration to serve static resources.\n\nHistory:\n2018-10-16: Initial vulnerability report published.",

        "description": "The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.",

This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.",

Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.

This attack applies to applications that: \\n1/ Use the HiddenHttpMethodFilter (it is enabled by default in Spring Boot). \\n2/ Allow HTTP TRACE requests to be handled by the application server. \\nThis attack is not exploitable directly because an attacker would have to make a cross-domain request via HTTP POST, which is forbidden by the Same Origin Policy.

So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. The previous CVE-2018-1261 prevented the framework itself from writing the file. While the framework itself now does not write such files, it does present the errant path to the user application, which could inadvertently write the file using that path. This specifically applies to the unzip transformer. This can only happen if an application using this library accepts and unpacks zip files from untrusted sources. Affected Pivotal Products and Versions: Spring Integration Zip Community Extension Project versions 1.0.1.RELEASE and earlier. Mitigation: Upgrade to the 1.0.2.RELEASE Or do not unzip untrusted zip files.",

In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way.

Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations.

For a detailed explanation of the JRE behaviour, see Markus Wulftange's blog and this archived MSDN blog.\n\nThis issue was identified by an external security researcher and reported to the Apache Tomcat security team via the bug bounty program sponsored by the EU FOSSA-2 project on 3rd March 2019. The issue was made public on 10 April 2019.\n\nAffects: \n- 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17\n- 8.5.0 to 8.5.39\n- 7.0.0 to 7.0.93",

In order to override the version, you need to declare/set the property spring-security-oauth.version.\n\nBelow are instructions for users of Spring Boot 1.5.x.\n\nTo override a property using Maven, declare the property in your pom’s <properties> section:\n\n<properties>\n<spring-security-oauth.version>2.0.18.RELEASE</spring-security-oauth.version>\n</properties>\n\nTo override a property using Gradle, configure the value in your build.gradle script:\n\next['spring-security-oauth.version'] = '2.0.18.RELEASE'\n\nOr in gradle.properties:\n\nspring-security-oauth.version=2.0.18.RELEASE\n\nNOTE: The same instructions apply for users of Spring IO Platform Cairo.

Furthermore, the hashes are salted using the username instead of a random salt, causing hashes for users with the same username and password to collide which is problematic especially for popular users like the default `admin` user. This essentially means that for an attacker, it might be feasible to reconstruct a user's password given access to these hashes. Note that attackers needing access to the hashes means that they must gain access to the database in which these are stored first to be able to start cracking the passwords. The problem is addressed in Opencast 8.1 which now uses the modern and much stronger bcrypt password hashing algorithm for storing passwords. Note, that old hashes remain MD5 until the password is updated. For a list of users whose password hashes are stored using MD5, take a look at the `/user-utils/users/md5.json` REST endpoint.",

        "description": "When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.",

Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known \"deserialization gadgets.\" Spring Security configures Jackson with global default typing enabled, which means that (through the previous exploit) arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true: (1) Spring Security's Jackson support is being leveraged by invoking SecurityJackson2Modules.getModules(ClassLoader) or SecurityJackson2Modules.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper); (2) Jackson is used to deserialize data that is not trusted (Spring Security does not perform deserialization using Jackson, so this is an explicit choice of the user); and (3) there is an unknown (Jackson is not blacklisting it already) \"deserialization gadget\" that allows code execution present on the classpath.

        "description": "Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a header that contains invalid characters. When a header like \"Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10\" is received, it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline. This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated with RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incoming headers has been updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that people upgrade to the new version of Waitress as soon as possible.",

Note, that with the current releases, the 2.0 branch of both Spring Data and Spring Boot is EOL and we highly recommend to upgrade\n\nImportant : It has been noticed by the Vulas team that the commit fixing the problem is already present in 1.11.19 (please notice that 1.11.19 and 1.11.20 have been released on the same day).",

However it is also possible to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the configuration parameter \"rs.security.keystore.type\" to \"jwk\". For this case all keys are returned in this file \"as is\", including all private key and secret key credentials. This is an obvious security risk if the user has configured the signature keystore file with private or secret key credentials. From CXF 3.3.5 and 3.2.12, it is mandatory to specify an alias corresponding to the id of the key in the JWK file, and only this key is returned. In addition, any private key information is omitted by default. \"oct\" keys, which contain secret keys, are not returned at all.",
