QUICK GUIDE: HOW TO IMPLEMENT A NEW RULE

1. Start by adding an entry to the RULES dictionary in the apply_rule function.
   Pick a clear rule id (all capitals, underscore separated) and a rule function
   (start with apply_rule_....)

2. Implement the rule function, which MUST take as input a datamodel.commit.Commit
   and an AdvisoryRecord and must return either None, if the rule did not match,
   or a string explaining the match that was found.

3. Do not forget to write a short comment at the beginning of the function explaining
   what the rule is about.

IMPORTANT: you are not supposed to change the content of function apply_rules, except
adding entries to its inner RULES dictionary.
