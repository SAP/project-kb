    cause human harm or physical damage, or modify dashboard settings via

    demonstrated on a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited FWD."""

In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize
with an improper input string, like "//../foo", or "\\..\\foo", the result would be
the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory,
but not further above (thus "limited" path traversal), if the calling code would
use the result to construct a path value."""

Apache Commons BeanUtils, as distributed in lib/commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar in
Apache Struts 1.x through 1.3.10 and in other products requiring
commons-beanutils through 1.9.2, does not suppress the class property, which
allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary
code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter
to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.
