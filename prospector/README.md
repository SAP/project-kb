# Prospector

Prospector is a tool to reduce the effort needed to find security fixes for
*known* vulnerabilities in open source software repositories.

It takes a vulnerability description (in natural language) in input and
produces in output a ranked list of commits, in decreasing order of relevance.

**WARNING** Please keep in mind that Prospector is a research prototype, currently
under development: feel free to try it out, but do expect some rough edges.

If you find an bug, please open an issue. I you can also fix the bug, please
create a pull request (make sure it includes a test case that passes with your correction
but fails without it)

## Setup (for development and demonstration purposes only!)

The easiest way to set up Prospector is to clone this repository and then run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/sap/project-kb
cd project-kb/prospector
git checkout prospector-assuremoss
echo "GIT_CACHE=/tmp/git-cache" > .env
echo "PYTHONPATH=." >> .env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example" >> .env
mkdir /tmp/git-cache
pipenv --python 3.8
pipenv install
pre-commit install
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

This is necessary only the first time you set up your dev. environment.
Afterwards, you will just have to remember to activate the environment
with `pipenv shell`.

If at any time you wish to remove the virtual environment and create it from scratch
(for example, because you want to use a different version of the python interpreter),
just do `pipenv --rm` and the repeat the steps above.

If you have issues with these steps, please open a Github issue and
explain in detail what you did and what unexpected behaviour you observed
(also indicate your operating system and Python version).

*Please note that Windows is not supported*, WSL should be fine though.


**IMPORTANT**: this project adopts `black` for code formatting. You may want to configure
your editor so that autoformatting is enforced "on save". The pre-commit hook ensures that
black is run prior to committing anyway, but the auto-formatting might save you some time
and avoid frustration.

## Starting the backend database and the job workers

Note: this section and the following assume you have performed succesfully the
steps in the *setup* section above.

This is achieved with docker and docker-compose, make sure you have both installed
and working before proceeding.

You can then start the necessary containers with the following command:

`docker-compose up -d --build`

This also starts a convenient DB administration tool at http://localhost:8080

## Starting the RESTful server

`uvicorn api.main:app --reload`

You can then point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the API.
You might also want to take a look at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Using the CLI

NOTE: this is about the "legacy" CLI. A new CLI is being developed.

`python main.py <vulnerability_id> -r <repository_url> -v`

Science during a graduation internship at SAP.
