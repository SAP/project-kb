# Prospector

## What is it
Prospector is a tool to reduce the effort needed to find security fixes for
*known* vulnerabilities in open source software repositories.

It takes a vulnerability description (in natural language) in input and
produces in output a ranked list of commits, in decreasing order of relevance.

**WARNING** Please keep in mind that Prospector is a research prototype,
currently under development: feel free to try it out, but do expect some rough
edges.

If you find a bug, please open an issue. If you can also fix the bug, please
create a pull request (make sure it includes a test case that passes with your correction
but fails without it)


## Setup (for development, testing, and demonstration purposes only!)

Prerequisites:

* Python 3.8
* pipenv
* postgresql

The easiest way to set up Prospector is to clone this repository and then run
the following commands:

```
git clone -b prospector-assuremoss https://github.com/sap/project-kb
cd project-kb/prospector
cp .env-sample .env
```

Modify the `.env` file as you see fit (to run the client only the `GIT_CACHE` variable must be set, the rest is for setting up the backend), then continue with:

```
set -a; source .env; set +a
mkdir -p $GIT_CACHE
```

Before proceding, in order to build the python requirements it is necessary to have the following installed:
```
gcc g++ libffi-dev python3-dev libpq-dev
```

Now you can install the dependencies by running:
```
make setup
```
or the development dependencies:
```
make dev-setup
```

This is necessary only the first time you set up your dev. environment.
Afterwards, you will just have to set the environment variables using the `.env` file.

If at any time you wish to use a different version of the python interpreter, beware that the `requirements.txt` file contains the exact versioning for `python 3.8.14`.

If you have issues with these steps, please open a Github issue and
explain in detail what you did and what unexpected behaviour you observed
(also indicate your operating system and Python version).

*Please note that Windows is not supported*, WSL and WSL2 are fine though.

**IMPORTANT**: this project adopts `black` for code formatting. You may want to configure
your editor so that autoformatting is enforced "on save". The pre-commit hook ensures that
black is run prior to committing anyway, but the auto-formatting might save you some time
and avoid frustration.

If you use VSCode, this can be achieved by pasting these lines in your configuration file:

```
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

## Starting the backend database and the job workers [OPTIONAL]

If you run the client without running the backend you will get a warning and have slower response times when making multiple queries. If you only intend to try out the client, feel free to skip this section and the next and go straight to "Using the CLI".

Note: this section and the following assume you have performed succesfully the
steps in the *setup* section above.

This is achieved with docker and docker-compose, make sure you have both installed
and working before proceeding.

You can then start the necessary containers with the following command:

`make docker-setup`

This also starts a convenient DB administration tool at http://localhost:8080

## Starting the RESTful server

`uvicorn api.main:app --reload`

Note, that it requires `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DBNAME` to be set in the .env file. 

You can then point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the API.
You might also want to take a look at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

*Alternatively*, you can execute the RESTful server explicitly with:

`python api/main.py`

which is equivalent but more convenient for debugging.


## Using the CLI

Try the following example:

`python client/cli/main.py CVE-2014-0050 --repository https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload --use-nvd`

or, specifying the tag interval to restrict the retrieval of candidate commits:

`python client/cli/main.py CVE-2014-0050 --repository https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload --use-nvd --tag-interval FILEUPLOAD_1_3:FILEUPLOAD_1_3_1`

In the example above, the tag interval has been chosen by considering the text of the advisory ("MultipartStream.java in Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.1 [...]") and comparing it with the set of tags found  in the git repository.

*HEADS-UP*: Prospector has the capability to "guess" tag names from version intervals, but that functionality is not yet exposed to the command line client (it will be in the future). If you are curious to know how that works, please see the last page of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13375).

## Testing

To run the tests, run:

`pytest`

Note, that `pytest` requires running instances of the backend and database either in containers or by previous commands.

The approach implemented in patch-finder is described in detail in this
document: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13375.pdf

This project is inspired by the prototype developed by Daan Hommersom as part of his thesis
done in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of
Science in Data Science & Entrepreneurship at the Jheronimus Academy of Data
Science during a graduation internship at SAP.
